# german-noun-classification

This is a small machine learning tool that predicts the gender of a noun in German. Currently, the methods used include: (i) decision tree (ii) random forest and (iii) an ensemble of the two. 

The decision tree is optimized using cost complexity pruning with an alpha of 0.001 and is currently the best performing model.

The code was constructed using input from OpenAI's ChatGPT. All resemblances to other code blocks are unintentional.
